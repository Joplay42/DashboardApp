# My note web application using firebase and react

Hey!

Here is my latest project, my personnal note application. It is made bu using react and firebase.
I wanted to experienced with firebase since I read so many good reviews about the firestore system to use database.
I create a authentification system using firebase/authentification. You can create an account or sign in with google to see your note, of course each users has its own notes.
You can store notes in the database, and even edit them after for full user experiences.
All my code has documentation so don't forget to check it out!
